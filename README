Test program for nRF24L01+ wireless device on Tiva TM4C Cortex-M4
microcontroller.

Send packets back-to-back, to maximise the throughput (without
retransmit, so unreliable transfer similar to UDP).

Able to get around 195 kbyte/second of payload data throughput.

Code is written in interrupt-drivent / event-driven style, allowing
transfers to run in the background, with the main program free to do
other things meanwhile.
